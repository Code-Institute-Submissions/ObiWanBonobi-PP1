# Introduction

I embarked on the journey of creating a website for my partner, who is a graphic designer, with a profound sense of purpose. Recognizing his extraordinary talent as a graphic designer, I wanted to offer a dedicated platform that would not only honor his work but also provide a showcase for his remarkable skills. This website stands as a testament to our shared commitment to creativity and design excellence. It's a space where his artistic endeavors can shine and captivate, where clients can discover the transformative power of design. 

By crafting this online presence, I aim to assist in amplifying his reach and connecting him with a broader audience that appreciates the craftsmanship and ingenuity he brings to every project. It's a digital canvas where his talents can truly flourish, and I'm thrilled to contribute to this creative endeavor that continues to inspire us both.

## User experience

I've meticulously crafted this online space to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. Ultimately, I want visitors to my website to feel inspired, informed, and connected. Whether they're seeking my partner's services, admiring his work, or just exploring the world of graphic design, I aim to provide an exceptional and memorable user experience that leaves a lasting impression.


## My vision for the website

The layout is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy to navigate through and explore his work. I've optimized the site for all devices, ensuring that whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the content remains accessible and aesthetically pleasing. I've paid close attention to loading times to keep the user engaged and prevent frustration. 

Whether it's the captivating visuals or the carefully crafted text, I've strived to create a harmonious blend that provides valuable information. In addition, I've included a user-friendly contact form, and Fabian is committed to a swift response. I've placed a strong emphasis on accessibility to ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, can enjoy the site without barriers.


# Features

### Navigation

The navitagion bar is always visible at the top of each page, for easy navigation. It includes :
- on the left side are Fabi's initials on small screens and his full name on bigger screens
- on the right side is a burger icon on small screens and the full navigation menu on bigger screens
- I gave the navigation bar a barely visible line underneath to show a difference between navigation bar to the main section

### Footer

The footer is at the bottom of each page and it includes a link to Fabian's instagram account. I gave the footer bar also a barely visible line above to show a difference between the footer and the main section.

### Collaborations navigation

On the left top side in the Collaborations page, I've added a "go down" icon that navigates to different collabs in the page. This helps move around quicker and more clearly.

### Home page

I've kept the design of the home page simple. 
- My train of thought was to have Fabian's designs to be the main attraction throughout the website. 
- In the second paragraph, the collaborations bubble, I added a link to the collaborations page.

### Collaborations page

- Same as the home page, I wanted to keep Fabians desings the main attraction. 
- On the left top side is a down arrow to navigate through fabians designs.
- Every picture in each < div > is cropped to the same size, to keep the page looking clean.
- I seperated some of the desings in different < div > so when they are shown on bigger screens, they stay together.

### Contact page

- The contact page includes a form that can be filled out to get into contact with Fabian.
- It also includes a map of where Fabian is based.
- After you press the send button, you will be taken to a new page that says thank you.

### Contact send page

- This page will only show after you filled out the contact form.
- It has a short thank you message with another desing.
- It was the same layout as the other pages so you can easily navigate back to the other pages.
